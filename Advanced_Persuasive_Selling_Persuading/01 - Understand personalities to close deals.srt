1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:02,02
- You might've heard

2
00:00:02,02 --> 00:00:05,05
that people may forget what you said and what you did,

3
00:00:05,05 --> 00:00:08,02
but they'll never forget how you made them feel.

4
00:00:08,02 --> 00:00:10,09
I'm paraphrasing a quote from Maya Angelou,

5
00:00:10,09 --> 00:00:14,01
but it applies perfectly to social selling.

6
00:00:14,01 --> 00:00:16,08
Prospective customers want to feel special.

7
00:00:16,08 --> 00:00:19,03
Like individuals, not just another client.

8
00:00:19,03 --> 00:00:21,07
If you can create this feeling,

9
00:00:21,07 --> 00:00:25,02
sales success will be more likely to follow.

10
00:00:25,02 --> 00:00:27,01
When we treat people as individuals

11
00:00:27,01 --> 00:00:29,09
and communicate with them in ways that convey respect,

12
00:00:29,09 --> 00:00:33,00
it's amazing the difference it can make on a professional

13
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:35,01
and personal level.

14
00:00:35,01 --> 00:00:36,02
The goal of this course

15
00:00:36,02 --> 00:00:39,03
is to help you enjoy more sales success.

16
00:00:39,03 --> 00:00:40,07
When you combine an understanding

17
00:00:40,07 --> 00:00:44,02
of the psychology of persuasion and personality styles,

18
00:00:44,02 --> 00:00:47,04
success will come quicker and more often.

19
00:00:47,04 --> 00:00:48,05
I'm Brian Ahearn,

20
00:00:48,05 --> 00:00:51,00
and I've been teaching salespeople, coaches,

21
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:52,03
business leaders and others

22
00:00:52,03 --> 00:00:56,04
how to ethically influence people for the past 15 years.

23
00:00:56,04 --> 00:00:59,05
In this course you'll learn three very important things

24
00:00:59,05 --> 00:01:03,03
when it comes to selling your products, services or ideas.

25
00:01:03,03 --> 00:01:05,00
First, you'll be introduced

26
00:01:05,00 --> 00:01:07,04
to some basic psychological concepts

27
00:01:07,04 --> 00:01:10,08
that will make it easier for people to say yes to you.

28
00:01:10,08 --> 00:01:13,00
Next, you'll learn how to quickly identify

29
00:01:13,00 --> 00:01:15,02
different personality types.

30
00:01:15,02 --> 00:01:17,00
Finally, and most important,

31
00:01:17,00 --> 00:01:19,07
you'll see which psychological concepts work best

32
00:01:19,07 --> 00:01:21,05
with each personality style.

33
00:01:21,05 --> 00:01:23,02
Are you ready to make that happen?

34
00:01:23,02 --> 00:01:25,00
Let's get started.
